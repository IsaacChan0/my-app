        Hi! Welcome to my website, my name is Isaac Chan
        and I am a current student at the University of Waterloo
        studying Mechatronics Engineering.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I am an aspiring self-taught pianist with an interest in
        software and all things computers!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        If you're interested check out my project page to see some
        of the things I've worked on.
